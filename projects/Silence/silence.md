## Overview

**Silence** is a cooperative stealth game created over the span of 4 months by a team of 6 students from the **Łódź University of Technology**.

It was made for the ZTGK 2023 contest and got to **TOP 3** in the **Game Development** category.

It was also awarded by the **11 bit studios** company.

The gameplay is focused on cooperation between the two players.
As an agent, you have to sneak around the map, avoiding the guards and activating the switches.
As a hacker, you have to help the agent by distracting the guards and hacking the security cameras.
Because of the asymmetry between the abilities of the two players, it's crucial that they communicate and cooperate with each other.
